# TTF - Nuxt 3
- Main goal of project is to find best way (also with last mile) to your desired destination, in this case, destination is Hotel Good Goisern in Bad Goisern.
- We have working connection to real OBB API, You just need to select departure station and time of departure and app will provide you shortest routes to final destination (same as OBB).
- Then you are able to picke one which you like most and look at last miles options which you have few of them (they are for now just mocks)
